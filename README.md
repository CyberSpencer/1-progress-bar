# 1% For The Planet Progress Tracker

A real-time visualization tracking AI Integration's™ commitment to environmental sustainability through our "1% For The Planet" initiative. For every 1,000 messages processed through our systems, we plant one tree, with a goal of 100 trees by 2026.

## Overview

This tracker provides a transparent view of our environmental impact, displaying:
- Real-time message processing metrics
- Tree planting progress
- Progress towards our 2026 goal

The visualization updates in real-time based on our message processing patterns (simulated for security reasons):

- Business Hours (9AM-5PM ET): 20-25 messages/hour
- Morning/Evening (5AM-9AM, 5PM-9PM ET): 10-15 messages/hour
- Night Hours (9PM-5AM ET): 2-5 messages/hour

*Note: For security purposes, message counts are simulated based on historical averages (~308 messages/day as of December 2024)*
